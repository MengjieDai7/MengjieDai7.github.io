<h3> Mental Health Educator </h3>
<h4>Part Time </h4>
<p> Since I have lived on my own in the mean South Korean streets I have come out the otherside with some "quirks." 
I teach everyone around me about what it means to have separation anxiety and slight leash aggression. 
I have educated dozens of humans about these topics. </p> 

<h3>Cuddle Bug</h3>
<h4>Part Time</h4>
<p> Now it may seem like I am an aggressive dog but dont be fooled. I am one of the sweetest dogs once you get to know me. 
I love cuddling with humans that I trust. I am very affectionate and just need to be given a chanced. </p> 

<h3>Annoying Little Brother  </h3>
<h4>Part Time </h4>
<p> Have I mentioned that I have a sister! Sometimes I annoy her a lot but I know Kelly loves me.
We go on our walks together and always sleep together. I am the best brother eventhough sometimes I get 
too excited and will run her over! </p>
