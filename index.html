    <h2>My Brief Bio</h2>
    <p>My life started in South Korea. I running around on the streets and gosh! The little kids would throw rocks at me.
    How dare they! Since those traumatic experiences from that moment on I vowed to growl at every little kid I would ever cross paths with that werent my owners. 
    I do not like little kids they can be so mean. I also had a couple of bad run ins with other dogs and adult males while I was living on the streets. I am distrustful of men 
    nd sometimes other dogs as well. </p>
	
	<p> Although I have not had the easiest time as a young pup, I would not trade it in for the world. When I was around a year old I was adopted by a
	Canadian-South Korean family. They found me on the streets and deciede to take me back home to Canada! I could not believe the opportunity I was getting!
	All I have ever known was living on the streets alone but now I have multiple meals a day, endless water, multiple beds, and most importantly unconditional love. </p>
	<p> Look at me living a life of luxury in Canada. </p>
